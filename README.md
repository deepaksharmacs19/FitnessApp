# FitnessApp

# Running the Application  
Since the application is a static frontend, you can run it by opening the index.jsp file in a web browser directly.    

  # Note : As it is instructed to create front end only so you can add the dummy data to check the flow of application but it will not be saved anywhere as for saving it i will have to create backend part.
  
Follow these steps:  
Locate the index.jsp file in the project directory.

Right-click on the file and choose "Open With" from the context menu.
   
Select your preferred web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) to open the file.   
Interacting with the Website

And if it does not work then you can also download tomcat server and can run this application.
Download the tomcat server and in its webapps folder keep this FitnessApp folder into it and then start the server.
And type localhost:8080/FitnessApp it would start showing page to you.
