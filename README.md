# FitnessApp

# Running the Application  
Since the application is a static frontend, you can run it by opening the index.jsp file in a web browser directly.    

  # Note : As it is instructed to create front end only so you can add the dummy data to check the flow of application but it will not be saved anywhere as for saving it i will have to create backend part.
  
Follow these steps:  
Locate the index.jsp file in the project directory.

Right-click on the file and choose "Open With" from the context menu.
   
Select your preferred web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) to open the file.
